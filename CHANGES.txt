Changelog
=========

1.5 (2012-05-02)
----------------

- Move the layout-aware form components to the grok package where the
  dependency with grokcore.formib can be mixed in.

- Add a directive ``layout`` to select a different type of layout. A layout
  type is defined on a ``Layout`` component with the help of the
  ``grokcore.component.provides`` directive. It defaults to ``ILayout``
  for compatibility.

- Change how the static resources are associated to a ``Layout``,
  using the new name ``__static_name__`` set by the template grokker.

1.4 (2011-07-13)
----------------

- Rename megrok.layout to grokcore.layout. ``application_url`` and ``flash``
  utilities have been removed, \*Form components have been renamed to
  \*FormPage.

- Added ExceptionPage, NotFoundPage and UnauthorizedPage layout-aware
  components.

- Fixed default template for grokcore.layout.Form component.

1.3 (2011-01-12)
----------------

- Compatibility with grokcore.view 2.3.

1.2.0 (2010-12-16)
------------------

- Update to use the new TemplateGrokker from grokcore.view.

1.1.0 (2010-03-03)
------------------

- ``z3c.flashmessage`` has been dropped in favor of
  ``grokcore.message``. This new package takes in charge the
  registration of the utilities and retains the existing API. The
  back-compatibility is assured.

1.0.2 (2010-02-26)
------------------

- The existence test for the `application_url` site-lookup was
  wrongly using a "if not" statement. In a case of a container, the object
  is evaluated to False if it's empty. We now use a proper "if .. is
  None". [trollfot]

1.0.1 (2010-02-25)
------------------

- Forms now inherit from `UtilityView` and therefore get the
  `application_url` and `flash` methods. Tests have been added to
  garanty the behavior. [trollfot]

1.0 (2010-02-25)
----------------

- The dependencies have been heavily cleaned up. All zope.app packages
  have been removed. We are now running with minimal dependencies and
  using the latest ZTK. This release will probably *not* run on
  `Grok 1.0`. You will need `Grok 1.1rc1` to be able to use
  it. [trollfot]

- Added a component called UtilityView that provides two useful
  methods : application_url, flash. These methods are almost a copy of
  what can be found in the `Grok` package. The application_url is
  using a simple getSite hook to get the root of the application. This
  might be irrelevant for some applications and can be overriden.
  [trollfot]

- Added a module called 'messages' that contains the flash messages
  utilities. This module is *NOT* grokked and must be grokked
  manually. This prevents conflicts with grokui.admin's own
  definitions of the very same components. It also allows you to
  override the `flash` method to use something else than
  z3c.flashmessage and then not be bothered by useless utilities. The
  flash messages utilities can be registered by including the
  ``messages.zcml`` file in your own project or package ZCML file.

0.9 (2009-09-26)
----------------

- Add default templates to form which doesn't contain an html and body
  tag.
  [sylvain]

- Add an AddForm, EditForm and DisplayForm, all aware of the layout
  component.
  [sylvain]

0.8 (2009-09-17)
----------------

- Remove the CodePage, since CodeView have been removed from
  grokcore.view.
  [sylvain]

0.7 (2009-09-15)
----------------

- Add a CodePage to be compatible with the last version of
  grokcore.view (higher than 1.9). This breaks compatibility with
  previous release. You need to change any Page using a render method
  to a CodePage.
  [sylvain]

- The content property on a Page is no longer a property, but a method
  as it's hidding exceptions. You might need to update your code to
  reflect that change as well.
  [sylvain]

- Fix MANIFEST.in.
  [sylvain]

0.6 (2009-09-14)
----------------

- switch the arguments order in calling the layout
  [cklinger, sylvain]

- add the CHANGES.txt
  [cklinger]

0.5 (2009-07-24)
----------------

- remove the grok dependency
